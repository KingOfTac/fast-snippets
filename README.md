# **FAST-Snippets**
Useful vscode snippets for common patterns when creating [FAST Components](https://github.com/microsoft/fast).

## **Features**
* The included snippets can automatically insert import directives for symbols that come from external packages.

## **Featured FAST snippets**

### **More Examples**
* [FAST Elements](examples/fast-element-classes/fast-element-classes.md)
* [Templating](examples/templating/template.md)
	* [Directives](examples/templating/directives.md)
	* [Bindings](examples/templating/bindings.md)
* [Styling](examples/styling/styling.md)

## **Known Issues**
***
* Sometimes extra imports get generated by a snippet.

## **Release Notes**
***
### 1.0.0
* Initial release
* Snippets for:
	* FAST custom element definitions with & without decorator syntax
	* FAST FoundationElement definitions
	* FAST element templates
	* FAST HTML directives
	* FAST template bindings
	* FAST element styles

### 1.5.0
* Completely re-did the snippets.
* Snippets can now automatically import symbols they contain that come from external packages.
	* Import behavior can be controlled by the `fastSnippets.generateImportsFromSymbols` setting.
	* Because vscode does not actually support this behavior for snippets, all of the included
	snippets had to be moved from their `.code-snippets` file and into a `CompletionItemProvider`.
	A side effect of this is the auto import behavior only works for the snippets included in this
	extension.
	* If [vscode#111007](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/111007) gets implemented, then this might work with user and global snippet files.
